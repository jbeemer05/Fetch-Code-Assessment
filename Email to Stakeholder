Hi,

Our analysis of Users, Products, and Transactions data revealed significant data gaps, including 26% of products lacking brand or manufacturer information, 92% of products not fully categorized, and 11% of transactions missing barcodes.
Among users aged 21 and older, the top brands based on receipts scanned are Nerds Candy, Dove, Sour Patch Kids, Hershey's, and Coca-Cola. This data could drive us to market these brands more to 21 and old users.
For users with accounts active for at least six months, the top five brands by sales revenue are Coca-Cola ($2,592.10), Annie's Homegrown Grocery ($2,383.92), Dove ($2,327.47), Barefoot ($2,284.59), and Oribe ($2,085.93). 
In the Dips & Salsa category, Tostitos outperformed competitors with the highest sales ($496.65) and quantity sold (80 units). 
Addressing data gaps and leveraging high-performing brands and categories could unlock further growth opportunities.
We need a more robust product list that includes a more complete Brand and Manufactuer data, and minimize missing data so that our analysis does not miss important insights.

Thank you,
Josh Beemer
